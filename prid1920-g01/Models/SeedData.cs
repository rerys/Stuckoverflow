To sum up, if the implementation cannot constant initialize it, then it must first zero initialize and then initialize it before any dynamic initialization happends.

When I try a naive approach to this, I get this result:

    {{today | date:'d days so far in LLLL'}}

> 13 13PM201818 18o fPMr in February

This is because, for instance `d` refers to the day.

How can I escape these characters in an Angular date pipe? I tried `\d` and such, but the result did not change with the added backslashes.

Then you could use the same syntax including escape sequence that momentjs supports.

Something like this could work, it is not an exhaustive solution in that it does not deal with localization at all and there is no error handling code or tests.

    import { Inject, Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

    @Pipe({ name: 'momentDate', pure: true })

    export class MomentDatePipe implements PipeTransform {

        transform(value: any, pattern: string): string {

            if (!value)

                return '';

            return moment(value).format(pattern);

        }

    }

And then the calling code:

    {{today | momentDate:'d [days so far in] LLLL'}}

For all the format specifiers see the [documentation for format][1]. 

Keep in mind you do have to import `momentjs` either as an import statement, have it imported in your cli config file, or reference the library from the root HTML page (like index.html).
